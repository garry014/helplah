          <li><h4>Chromebook vs. laptop: Which is right for me?</h4>
            Decisions, decisions. A traditional Laptop or a Chromebook? You want a thin and light PC, but which of these portable systems is best for you?
            <br>
            <br>Does a laptop's overall versatility make it the better option? Or is a Chromebook's minimalistic operating system (OS) and web-based usability more suited to your needs? Keep reading to learn the differences between a Chromebook and a standard laptop, the relative advantages of each device, and which one will serve your needs with the most overall value.</li>
          <li><h4>What's the difference between a Chromebook and a laptop?</h4>
          While both laptops and Chromebooks are portable PCs intended to be used anywhere a computer is needed – say, at a desk, on the couch, or while traveling – there are many differences between the two devices, some of which may be critical to your buying decision.</li>

          <li><h4>Differences between Chromebooks and traditional laptops</h4>
          Technically, both standard laptops and Chromebooks are “laptops,” in that each device is portable and can be operated while resting on your lap.<br>
          <br>Laptops: Most users are already familiar with laptops. A laptop is controlled by a PC operating system such as Microsoft Windows 10 that provides the familiar "desktop" workspace where you launch programs, write documents, save files, and so on. Hundreds of gigabytes (at least) of internal storage are provided either by a spinning hard disk drive (HDD) or a solid-state drive (SSD). Laptops may also have added features such as optical drives (i.e., DVD, CD, etc.), and multiple ports to connect external devices and accessories.<br><br>
          Chromebooks: Unlike laptops that can slow-down when low on memory or accessing internal storage components.
          <ul id="new">
            <br><li><b>Chrome OS:</b> Chromebooks are powered by the lightweight (compared to Windows) Google Chrome OS, which uses the Chrome web browser as the primary user interface (UI). Nearly everything is done online within the Chrome browser or via the cloud – improving system speed and efficiency across the board.</li>
            <br><li><b>Browser-based web apps:</b> Chromebooks are built to use web-based applications rather than software you load into local storage. Web-based apps can be accessed anytime, anywhere. Simply enter the URL of the web-based tool and start being productive.</li>
            <br><li><b>Memory and cloud storage:</b> Another advantage of web-based apps is that they typically reduce demands on your RAM. And while there is some local storage on a Chromebook, users typically save their documents, photos, music, and other files on the cloud, with convenient features for syncing and storing data across devices (e.g., your Chromebook, tablet, and smartphone).</li>
          </ul>
          <br>Chromebooks rarely sport the latest, fastest processors because they don’t need them. And many features are intentionally absent, such as advanced graphics cards, large storage drives, and so on – all to make Chromebooks more lightweight and streamlined compared to regular laptops.
          <br><br>Of course, Chromebooks are less customizable than laptops. They offer a certain feature set, and that’s that.</li>
          <li><h4>How are laptops and Chromebooks similar?</h4>
          Some of the points mentioned here are not exclusive to one system or another. Laptops can use cloud storage and web applications, just like laptops. Chromebooks have multiple ports and USBs, just fewer of them than many laptops.
          <br>
          <br>The essential difference between Chromebooks and standard laptops will always be the Chrome OS and how it impacts operations. Still, there are several categories where Chromebooks and laptops score roughly equally:
          <ul id="new">
            <br><li><b>Battery life:</b> Laptop battery life has improved over the years, partly because designers have found ways to add more and bigger batteries without making them too heavy. Chromebooks have less room for big batteries but get more out them, thanks to their lightweight OS.</li>
            <br><li><b>Portability:</b> All Chromebooks are designed to be extremely thin and light. Laptops have a far wider range of sizes and weights, but you can easily find a Chromebook-sized laptop. Lenovo’s Ideapad series has many options that compare to the ultraportable Chromebook.</li>
            <br><li><b>Durability:</b> Laptops with sturdy frames and keyboards have long been popular for military and heavy-duty industrial use. Chromebooks are catching up, with fewer moving parts and features like rubber bumpers, reinforced ports, and stronger corners to limit damage from accidental drops.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>Plus, as the Chrome OS evolves, more PC-like capabilities become available. For example, some Chromebooks now provide an optional Windows-style desktop. Likewise, PC operating systems are in some ways becoming more Chrome-like. Windows 10 runs its basic apps similar the way the Chrome OS does. And you can obtain more apps on the Microsoft Store, just as you can get them from the Chrome Web Store and Google Play.
          </li>
          <li><h4>How Do I Connect my Laptop to my TV?</h4>
          The options for connecting a laptop to a TV just keep expanding. Tried-and-true methods, such as using HDMI or DVI cables, are easier than ever with higher maximum display resolutions and automatic device-to-device syncing. Or you can go cable-free using new wireless screen-sharing solutions - including some that require no additional hardware such as dongles or set-top receivers.</li>
          <li><h4>Connecting a laptop to a TV wirelessly</h4>
          Two of the most popular wireless methods for displaying a laptop screen on a TV are Google Chromecast and the screen-casting tool that's built into Microsoft Windows 10, based on technology called Miracast.</li>
          <li><h4>Connect laptop to TV: Windows 10</h4>
          If you've got a Windows 10 laptop and a compatible TV, one of the easiest ways to transmit your laptop screen to your TV is to use the new screen-casting capabilities that are built into the Windows 10 interface. Just go to the Action Center and click Connect. Your laptop will scan for and give you options to connect to any nearby Miracast-enabled device.
          <br><br>The beauty of technologies such as Miracast is that they don't rely on your home/office wireless network. Instead, signals are transmitted via Wi-Fi Direct, which has a shorter signal range but enables device-to-device streaming without a central router.</li>
          <li><h4>Connecting a laptop to a TV using cables</h4>
          There are multiple options for connecting a laptop to a TV using cables such as HDMI, DVI or even old-style VGA. The key is finding the best cable option that works with the ports you’ve got on your laptop and TV.</li>
          <li><h4>Choosing a Gaming Laptop vs. Desktop</h4>
          There's nothing like a cutting-edge gaming machine. Whether you're a hardcore gamer or an amateur enthusiast, you can take your favorite hobby to the next level with a new PC. The tricky part is deciding whether to invest in a gaming laptop or desktop. In the past, that was a fairly easy question to answer, since gaming laptops couldn't come close to the performance and customizability of a desktop. However, gaming laptops have continued to evolve in the past few years, packing incredible features into a portable package. In this FAQ, we've outlined the pros and cons of a gaming laptop vs. desktop, so that you can make an educated purchase and enjoy the best that gaming has to offer.</li>
          <li><h4>Advantages of a Gaming Desktop</h4>
            In many ways, pitting a gaming desktop against a gaming laptop can feel like an unfair fight – almost like a heavyweight boxer going up against a lightweight. Gaming desktops are much larger machines than their laptop counterparts, and their expansive designs can pack a lot more features inside. Here are some of the top reasons to choose a gaming desktop:
            <br>
            <br><b>Performance</b>
            <br>Most laptops are designed with mobile-specific processors, which are usually less powerful than their desktop equivalents, because they have to fit into a smaller frame. On the other hand, gaming laptops have significantly more space to work with, so they can pack more processing power inside. That's also true for the cooling system, which has to be cleverly engineered in a laptop, but can be more effective in a desktop design. Heavy-duty gaming will tax your system and cause it to heat up, but a gaming desktop can put more cooling fans and pads in place to keep your PC running smoothly.
            <br>
            <br><b>Customization</b>
            Gaming desktops tend to be way more customizable than laptops, because there's only so much tweaking and expanding you can do with a portable machine. With a desktop, if you want to add a second hard drive or an updated graphics card, it's as easy as unscrewing the case and replacing the part with some simple tools. Gaming laptops may have the option to replace a hard drive or battery, but it's a much trickier process, and you'll have to find the perfect replacement part for your machine.
            <li><h4>Advantages of a Gaming Laptop</h4>
              Gaming laptops can go with you anywhere, which is a pretty big selling point if you like gaming on-the-go. But there are quite a few reasons to choose a gaming laptop over a desktop – especially if you're a college student or a digital nomad. Here are some of the top advantages of a gaming laptop:
              <br>
              <br><b>Portability</b>
              <br>Laptops are thin and lightweight enough to bring to a coffee shop, your friend's house, or your couch. On the other hand, a gaming desktop is pretty much bound to your desk, unless you decide to pack it up and lug it to another location. Gaming laptops are all about freedom and mobility. Everything you need is packed into one device – including the display, keyboard, mouse, and speakers.
              <br>
              <br><b>No Need for a Separate Monitor</b>
              <br>Even though gaming laptop displays tend to be smaller than the average desktop monitor, they usually boast impressive resolution. Plus, the display is included when you purchase a laptop, whereas desktop monitors are often sold separately from PC towers. If you want to enjoy next-gen gaming but would rather not deal with putting together a rig, then a gaming laptop is probably perfect for your lifestyle.</li>
              <li><h4>When to Choose a Gaming Laptop Over a Gaming Desktop</h4>
                There are some serious differences between gaming laptops and desktops, and even though most desktops win out on the performance side, there are significant trade-offs as well. It's important to choose the right machine that fits your needs, and for many people, a gaming laptop will offer more than enough power to satisfy. Here are a few key areas where a gaming laptop shines:
                <br>
                <br><b>It Doubles as a Work Laptop</b>
                <br>Gaming laptops tend to have more computing power than the average non-gaming laptop, so they're a great option if you're looking for a work/play machine. You'll have more than enough speed to handle video conferences and creativity software, but when it's time to clock out, you'll be ready to play the latest AAA titles on the same computer. This is because gaming laptops are designed to handle cutting-edge graphics and processing tasks, whereas a normal laptop offers a less impressive experience overall.
                <br>
                <br><b>It Doubles as a School Laptop</b>
                <br>Likewise, the latest gaming laptops are a perfect choice for college students in need of an all-in-one PC for study sessions and gaming marathons. Of course, students will need to demonstrate enough self-control to not boot up a game when it's just a few clicks away, but that's a potential problem with any device. Only difference is, a gaming laptop will run the game with better graphics and a smoother frame rate.
                <br>
                <br><b>You Can Game Anywhere</b>
                <br>If you're the type of person that's always on the road or constantly moving around, there's no reason to weigh yourself down with a gaming desktop. Today's gaming laptops can fit easily in a backpack, so you can bring one on a weekend getaway or a local gaming tournament. And if you're traveling internationally, you won't ever worry about running out of entertainment on a long layover.</li>

              <li><h4>Everything you need to know about SSD, HDD, and laptop storage</h4>
                Laptops are amazing machines. Computers are capable of running the gamut from spreadsheets, to DJ software, and everything in between. While you’re probably familiar with the differences between a 11” screen and a 15” screen laptop, or a laptop built for gaming vs. one that’s meant for business, we bet you don’t spend a lot of time thinking about your computer’s hard drive – but you should.
                <br>
                <br>Not all hard drives are the same and when you buy a new laptop, you’ll be asked to choose from the available options of storage. Knowing the difference between the various types of hard drives and amount of storage space can help you decide on the right one.
                <br>
                <br>Between memory, processors, display options, and a laundry list of other tech specs to consider when shopping, it can get confusing fast. Hard drive storage doesn’t have to be.
                <br>
                <br>Here’s everything you need to know about hard drives and laptop storage.
                <br>
                <br><b>Hard Disk Drives vs Solid State Drives</b>
                <br>There are two different kinds of hard drives: the traditional spinning hard drive and the newer, faster solid-state drive.
                <br>
                <br><b>Hard disk drive:</b> A hard disk drive (HDD) uses spinning metal platters, onto which data gets written and read by a magnetic head at the end of mechanical arm. This type of hard drive has been around for decades and is probably the one you’re most familiar with.
                <br>
                <br>Over the years, HDDs have gotten bigger in capacity, smaller in size, and faster in reading and writing data. HDDs are also optimized for efficient energy consumption and handling the vibration of a laptop. The old-school hard disk drive is a good go-to option.
                <br>
                <br><b>Solid-state drive:</b> A solid-state drive (SSD) doesn’t have a spinning disk like its HDD counterpart, which makes it faster, lighter, and more reliable. SSDs are essentially collections of memory microchips that read and write data over and over again, to store all your files.
                <br>
                <br>While HDDs store data in the same way that songs get recorded on vinyl records – in long sequences of ones and zeroes – SSDs store data in memory cells, which is inherently more efficient and way faster. Weighing almost nothing, with no moving parts, and with seemingly no end to how small these drives can get, SSDs are the perfect disk drive for laptops.</li>
                <li><h4>Which is better, SSD or HDD?</h4>
                  While both storage types have read and write capabilities to store your data and can hold on to that data even when there’s no power (unlike RAM), SSDs have an inherent advantage over the older, spinning disk technology of HDDs.
                  <br>
                  <br>A HDD can suffer from file fragmentation, which is where different pieces of a single document are kept on different sections of the disk. The mechanical magnetic head of a hard disk drive has to travel from location to location to gather up this data when it’s needed, which takes time.
                  <br>
                  <br>A SSD on the other hand, can access any part of its memory instantly, since there are no moving parts. This means fast boot-up times (sometimes in a matter of seconds!) and quick data transfer speeds, giving the SSD an edge on speed to which no HDD can compare.
                  <br>
                  <br>With no moving parts and less chance of something going wrong, the SSD is also the winner when it comes to storing data over long periods of time. For long-term data storage, SSDs are the best bet for safe-keeping of important documents, family photos, and other files you’d like to access later down the road.</li>
                <li><h4>What is an Ultrabook?</h4>
                  First there was the laptop, the first truly portable PC. Then came smaller, lighter tablets and netbooks, which were similar to laptops but achieved their tiny size by sacrificing internal storage, battery life, processor speed, and so on. Finally came the Ultrabook -- as small as many netbooks or tablets but with internal components and computing abilities more like those of a full-fledged laptop.
                  <br>
                  <br>At least, that was the expectation. Yes, very thin and very powerful laptops have become a huge part of the home and business PC market. But while the concept is alive and thriving, the term Ultrabook -- conceived and trademarked by Intel Corp. -- has not taken off as a broadly recognized product category of its own.</li>
                  <li><h4>Where did the term Ultrabook come from?</h4>
                    The term Ultrabook was coined (and trademarked) in 2011 by Intel Corp. With slate-style tablet PCs and low-powered netbooks becoming popular, the company saw a growing consumer appetite for laptops that would be nearly as thin as tablets but offer faster processors and other features found in higher-end systems.
                    <br>
                    <br>In particular, Intel saw a market for its new generation of low-energy, low-heat processors, which it designed to operate within the tight confines of a small laptop frame while still running at up to 2.0 GHz cycle times or more. The company worked with multiple PC manufacturers to combine its new chips with advances in storage and battery technology, and the first highly portable -- and highly powerful -- Ultrabook-labeled systems hit stores in late 2011.</li>
                <li><h4>Tablet vs. 2-in-1</h4>
                2-in-1s borrow features from both laptops and tablets to deliver the best of both worlds. Although 2-in-1s combine the capabilities of a laptop and tablet into one device, sometimes a traditional tablet is still preferred as the better option.</li>
                <li><h4>Which is Better: A Tablet or a 2-in-1?</h4>
                  2-in-1 computers, also called 2-in-1 laptops, operate in two modes: Tablet mode and laptop mode. In tablet mode, a 2-in-1 functions like a tablet, presenting a great option when shopping for a device that has the benefits of a tablet like touch screen display, with the added full-functionality of a laptop.
                  <br>
                  <br>To help you decide if a 2-in-1 or tablet is best for you, let’s review the relative pros and cons of the hybrid 2-in-1 versus the standalone “slate” style tablet.</li>
