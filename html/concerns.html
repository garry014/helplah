        <center><h2>Other Concerning issues,<br>you would want to consider about</h2></center><br>
        <h2>1. Overheating</h2>
        Overheating can rob your laptop performance and often causes system crashes and freezing. Every computer generates lots of heat, but laptops especially tend to overheat due to their small size and lack of ventilation. Also, excessive dust can clog air vents and deprive your system of cold air to cool off.
        <br>
        <br>You can solve the overheating issue simply by cleaning out the air vents with a smooth cloth or a keyboard cleaner. To prevent further dust clogging, you can place a piece of filtered cloth over the inhalation vent. Don’t place it on the exhaust vent, as that is from where the hot air flows out quickly.
        <br>
        <br>If this does not work, update your system’s BIOS; it controls the laptop’s hardware. Most laptop manufacturers offer an installation file for updating BIOS files automatically, for heat management. Always remember that your laptop should be connected to the power supply while updating the BIOS.<br><br>
        <h2>2. Viruses or Malware</h2>
        Nothing can cripple the performance of your laptop more than viruses or malware. The best way to prevent viruses from entering your laptop is to have an antivirus software installed. In case you do not want to spend money on antivirus software, you can use some free tools like ‘Ad-Aware’ and ‘Spybot: Search and Destroy’ as a defense from the viruses and malware.<br><br>
        <h2>3. Sound Quality</h2>
        If you are a moviegoers, or someone who cannot live without music, a search for a good audio system is definetly needed. You may want to visit the store to checkout on the audio.
        <br>
        <br>If your ideal laptop doesn't have good sound system, you may want to add in an additional $100-200 for an addtional audio system such as a speaker or a headphone. These investments will help to solve bad audio system on a typical laptop.
